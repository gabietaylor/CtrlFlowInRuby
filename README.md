# CtrlFlowInRuby

#### Time to get flexible with Ruby. It can take user input, but it always producea the same result based on that input; it doesn't change its behavior in reaction to the environment (the collection of all variables and their values that exist in the program at a given time).

#### Control flow gives flexibility. Different outcomes can be selected depending on information the user types, the result of a computation, or the value returned by another part of the program.
